# Problem 7 Solution

## My Solution

I created Python Class [number_theory.numbers.primes()](../number_theory/numbers.py) to list the number of prime numbers up to either a number limit or quantity limit. For this problem we can use the quantity limit to get the first 10,001 prime numbers and index the list one.
