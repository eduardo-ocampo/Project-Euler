# Problem 1 Solution

This is the first problem and meant to be easy. After writing a 'for' an 'if' loop to get the multiples, I realized this can be accomplished easily by using a list comprehension. It took me a bit of practice to understand when to use a list comprehension, but I now know the power it holds. For this reason I really enjoy using Python as a programming language to solve complex problems.
