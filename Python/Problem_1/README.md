# Problem 1 Solution

## The Problem
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
## My Solution
This is the first problem and meant to be easy. After writing a `for` and `if` loop to get the multiples, I realized this can be accomplished easily by using a list comprehension. It took me a bit of practice to understand when to use a list comprehension, but I now know the power it holds. For this reason I really enjoy using Python as a programming language to solve complex problems.
