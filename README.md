# Project Euler

Hello! This is a repo containing my solutions to various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. [I am an engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-ocampo) and do not have a strong programming or mathematical background. However, puzzles have always interested me. I grew up trying to solve Hanayama metal puzzles or thinking endlessly about riddles. What I like about Project Euler is the variety of puzzles they host. Some which require a clever use of data structures. My language of choice for this is Python.  

I want to use this platform to provide the scripts, and thought process I used to problem solve. The goal is not to provide anyone with solutions they can use, but rather illustrate my problem solving abilities using Python. Some of these puzzles took me a while to solve. I hope if you are here it's to view my portfolio and not to deprive yourself of an 'Aha!' moment.
